# Foundations of Game Engine Development in Rust

This code is based off Eric Lengyel's excellent book series, [Foundations of Game Engine Development](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/). The first volume explains the mathematics of game engines with clarity and simplicity. The code in the book is written in C/C++ probably because most game engines are written in C/C++.
I decided to write my version of the game engine math in Rust, mostly for the following reasons:

- I don't know any better. There are high quality game engines written in both C/C++, Unity and Godot, as well as [Rust](http://arewegameyet.com/categories/engines/). I could use those but I like to understand what is happening at a more basic level.
- I really like Rust and want to get better with it.
- I learn best by doing and can learn both 3D math and Rust at the same time.
